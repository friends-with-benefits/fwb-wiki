#Get Involved 

There are many ways to contribute to FWB. In addition to participating in the Discord and IRL events, members have the opportunity to get involved with the DAO’s governance, weigh in on existing projects, spin up creative proposals for the DAO to vote on, and receive funding for community-approved projects.

Additionally, members and contributors who help steward the DAO’s ongoing initiatives and operations are compensated for their work. Funded opportunities arise in harmony with the group’s needs, and vary based on the DAO’s evolving priorities.
