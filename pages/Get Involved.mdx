# Get Involved  

There are many ways to contribute to FWB. In addition to participating in the Discord and IRL events, members have the opportunity to get involved with the DAO’s governance, weigh in on existing projects, spin up creative proposals for the DAO to vote on, and receive funding for community-approved projects.

Additionally, members and contributors who help steward the DAO’s ongoing initiatives and operations are compensated for their work. Funded opportunities arise in harmony with the group’s needs, and vary based on the DAO’s evolving priorities.

## Grants

FWB is a collective experiment for how Web3 tools can enable new ways of thinking and creating. Members should always feel empowered to propose projects, rally a squad, and make all kinds of things happen.

FWB Garage™,  our grant program, makes it easier for members to propose, fund, and produce a creative project that benefits the FWB community. For season six, Garage Grants distributed up to $50K worth of $FWB to get member-led projects off the ground.

## Voting (Snapshots) 

FWB uses a token-weighted voting system with no quorum. We use a decentralized voting system called [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) to vote on all proposals. [View our archive](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth) of Snapshot votes.

Delegation is an option if token holders want to navigate to Snapshot and delegate their votes, however it is not time-boxed and is not part of a formal process.

Community members are able to submit proposals by first filling out a micro-proposal to the Governance Team who then prepares that proposal for #live-discussion. Proposals are in #live-discussion for a minimum of 5 days. Proposals are then moved from #live-discussion to Snapshot and then ultimately voted on (see the proposal section after this for more details). 

*Voting Topics*

The Governance Team reviews proposals to ensure they are in alignment with FWB’s mission and values and the overall health of the DAO. Similarly, there is not a formal split as to which things go to Snapshot and which can be decided within Discord or another forum. Generally, our best practices are applied such that those items that have a meaningful impact to the DAOs resources (treasury, human capital, etc.) are taken to Snapshot vote.

*Voting Timelines*

While we do not have a set time for how long proposals must stay up on Snapshot, we typically require a minimum of 3 working days for any proposal, and often 7 full days.
