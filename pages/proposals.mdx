# üåü Proposals

### üí° **What Is a Proposal?**

At FWB, members can create a proposal for a project that they think would benefit the FWB community.

One way to think of a proposal is a trade offer: "Proposal: FWB commits _\<X>_, and in return we receive _\<Y>_". Members can help shape the future of FWB by participating in governance and by creating proposals.

At the time of this writing, proposals are usually done in an ad hoc manner, although there is a formalized proposals process set to be released in the near future by the Governance Team.

Proposals typically start with a conversation in any FWB Discord channel. From there, the next step is for one or more members to create a Google doc outlining the project, its impact, and the project's request for funding. The Google doc is built off the [FWB Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYMfg9n2FOWm8qyRSxaVLcw2f0lhUwjLd1jDLKYVGwQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Once the proposal doc is created, a thread is created in the [#live-proposals](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/912826702311329812/913552142319632384) channel, and the proposal is discussed and workshopped.

[Here's one example](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/871132840744607745/912826702311329812)

Proposals are typically green-lit and receive funding at the beginning of a Season, but are occasionally green-lit mid-Season if the need is urgent.

### üåü **What Can You Propose?**

Community-led initiatives that require support from the DAO start life as a proposal. If you have an idea for an opportunity to improve FWB or a solution to a problem you see in FWB, a proposal is a good way to make it happen.

Here are some examples of what FWB members can propose:

* Product initiatives
* DAO-wide marketing or brand campaigns
* Digital events
* Channels
* Treasury investing strategies
* Forming new teams that sit alongside Editorial, Product, etc.

### üê£ FWB Proposal Committee

The FWB Proposal Committee helps set up the structure for how the community creates and interacts with proposals.

Since FWB is a DAO, the committee's goal is to be hands-on for one or two Seasons until the proposal process is established in the community. The committee will help prepare proposals for a vote and push them to the right groups (partnerships, full community snapshot, etc.). They do not decide what is approved.

### ‚úçÔ∏è FWB Proposal Process

1. Community led proposals start as an idea and are workshopped in whatever the way the proposer(s) want: alone, in the Discord, or with the proposal review committee.

2. When the proposal is sufficiently coherent the proposer(s) will fill out the [FWB Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYMfg9n2FOWm8qyRSxaVLcw2f0lhUwjLd1jDLKYVGwQ/edit).

3. Contributors must make any conflict of interest (potential or possible) disclosures as necessary within the proposal. 

4. The proposal is shared with the Proposal Review Committee who will provide feedback and connect the proposer(s) with relevant FWB teams that may have feedback. The finance team is always included to review that the proposal‚Äôs budgetary impact has been accurately estimated. 

5. After this feedback is provided and the proposer(s) feel confident then the proposal is posted to #live-proposals where everyone is notified and public final feedback is provided. There is no set time it is up for, but we tend to have a best practice of at least 1 week.

6. The proposer(s) adjusts their proposal as they want and the Proposal Review Committee will then post it to Snapshot for community vote and notify everyone.

### ‚ö° Voting On Proposals as an FWB Member

FWB members vote on proposals to approve them in the DAO. To do this [we use Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth), which is a Web3 voting tool, that uses an off-chain signing mechanic. This allows people to create and vote on proposals without having to pay gas fees.

[See previous FWB proposals here.](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth)

To use Snapshot, connect your wallet which holds $FWB and vote on an open proposal on the site. Proposals are only open for a certain period of time. Some proposals come with a POAP that you can claim after casting your vote.
