# Welcome to the FWB Wiki :eight_spoked_asterisk:

Friends with Benefits (FWB) is a worldwide group of cultural creators, thinkers, and builders who convene digitally and IRL to collaboratively shape Web3’s future. 

Home to many subcultures, FWB exists as an ecosystem of symbiotic relationships, a decentralized creative studio, and a never-ending group chat. Above all, it is an evolving experiment.

We hold $FWB tokens to collectively fund and govern our community endeavors and co-own what we create, together. 

At our core, we are a growing social DAO with more than 3,000 members—including artists, builders, and thinkers from across various Web3 and cultural sectors. Collectively, we aim to catalyze the power of Web3 as a tool for creating and making things happen.

Since our inception in 2020, FWB has become a model for how a DAO can produce a diverse array of events, collaborations, and products that serve our community's needs while pushing culture forward.

This FWB Wiki will serve as a knowledge base for all members to cover many questions about how the DAO operates – from our membership application process, to tokenomics, community software and more. This Wiki was developed to serve as a relevant source of information for both new and longtime members. As DAO evolves and changes, so will this document, so check back here regularly for updates. 

Do you have a question about something that isn’t here or did you think of something that would be useful to add for other members? Jump to the section on about our process for updating the Wiki.
