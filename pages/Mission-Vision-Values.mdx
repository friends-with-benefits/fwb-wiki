# Vision, Mission, Values

## Vision

What is the future world we want to live in? Why does FWB exist?

We believe in the promise of a better internet---one where communities and authentic connections thrive, where creativity is valued, and where the future can be collaboratively built.

## Mission

What do we want to accomplish every day that helps us actualize that vision?

FWB is the social convening point for the individuals, squads, and institutions using decentralized technology to build a better internet. As a community, we aim to push culture forward while elevating and amplifying each other in the process.

## Strategic Approaches

How do we accomplish our mission, and work towards our vision?

The FWB community accomplishes our mission by acting as a new kind of social network---one that values intimacy over scale, governs and sustains itself, and seamlessly blurs the lines between meaningful digital and physical experiences.

We currently use Discord as a 24/7 chat room that functions like a virtual city.

We come together once a year to collaboratively produce an event known as FWB FEST, where our digital city temporarily comes to physical life. We also organize in-person events around the world, hosted by and for our community, that serve as local neighborhoods.

We build and operate our own social software---a set of tools that aligns us and uniquely serves the needs of our community. (e.g. fwb.app, gatekeeper, FairShare)

We produce and publish our own essays, news, and stories to contribute new ideas while amplifying and uplifting one another across this network.

We collectively maintain, evolve, and improve our community through member-driven proposals that spur economic and social activity, and deepen connections.

All of this aims to collectively push this format of what a social network is and can be---one that is operated, governed, and attributed to its "users."

In this regard, FWB can be thought of as a city that does not exist in a singular physical place, but is instead fluid, emergent, and collectively defined by the creativity and interdependence of its people.

## Core Principles

What behaviors or patterns do we as a community embody in order to accomplish our mission and work towards our vision?

Collective Effort: We believe in cooperation and collaboration. FigJam over Notes. It takes a village.

Good Neighbors: We all have a stake in making our shared home great. Be friendly, be inclusive, be a good host, and if you see trash, pick it up.

Culture Over Crypto: We're not a crypto community, we're a community that uses crypto. Let's set a new tone for this new internet.

Open Experimentation: Remix, remodel. Emergence over instructions. The only "right way" to do things is through radical creativity.

Civic Engagement: We have a responsibility to show how decentralized technology can benefit the public, and to use our influence as a force for good.

Give Before You Get: Offer your support without expecting something in return. Credibility is built through authentic, caring connections.

Have Fun: We don't take ourselves too seriously, and we don't have all the answers -- but that's what makes this worth doing.
