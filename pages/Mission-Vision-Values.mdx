# Vision, Mission, Values

## Vision

FWB represents the needs of cultural creators and maintainers and equips them with the community and Web3 tools they need to gain agency over their production. 

We do this by: 

1. Acting as an entrance into Web3, physically, digitally, and conceptually. We create IRL events, digital spaces, and stories that connect Web3 potential to cultural narratives. 
2. By using Web3 tools and spaces to build community, connect with diverse perspectives, and empower participants to form their own subcultures. 
3. By creating tools, works of art, and products that showcase the potential of Web3 and create measurable change in the lives of cultural creators and maintainers
4. Understanding that our position of influence requires the responsibility to act as delegates, collectively governing and representing the needs of cultural creators and maintainers within FWB, the Web3 space, and beyond

## Mission & Roadmap

We strive to accomplish this vision through the development of Web3 native experiences and tools that are co-created by and for the FWB community through a series of work streams ranging from Events, Membership, Products, Editorial, Grants, and more. 

While a traditional company or organization may have the privilege of one explicit reason for existence, the FWB DAO emerged first as a social community – making sense of how the Web3 world was evolving and affecting culture –that then came together to determine what it's focus areas should be, resulting in various funding initiatives to drive value and benefits to its community in those areas. 

The first Roadmap presented to the FWB community from FWB contributors was shared in a community Town Hall on August 16, 2021.

Ultimately, FWB has always viewed itself as an internet-native city, in that its experience means different things to different people, but with the ultimate goal of creating a sense of place, identity, and community that brought together individuals with shared values and aspirations.

## Values

We act according to four core values: agency, convergence, advocacy, and ownership. 

Agency is about the permission and capabilities to act. It’s about having the values, tools, and support needed to free oneself from the constraints of centralized platforms and take more direct actions in one’s own work, community, and livelihood. 

Convergence is about the ability to self organize and self govern. It is both the space + tools to converge different perspectives and embrace the new conversations and identities they create. It is the ability to self-select one’s community and feel a sense of security and belonging within it.

Advocacy is about amplification and action. It’s about providing space, tools, and teams to the voices of cultural creators and maintainers who have historically been underrepresented and undercompensated. 

Ownership is about capturing the value one creates. It’s about finding new ways to measure and compensate for forms of cultural contributions that have been overlooked.
