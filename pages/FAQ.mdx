## General Questions

**Q: How do I get started on the FWB Discord?**

The FWB Discord consists of a number of channels where you can hang out and chat about any of your interests. If you‚Äôre new to the Discord, say hello in the #introductions channel and stop by other channels that interest you. Once a month, we host a voice chat for the new member hang where you‚Äôll get an idea of how things work around here. You‚Äôll get a quick Discord 101, learn about the history of FWB, Discord channels, events, and how to get involved. Keep an eye out on the [events section](https://www.fwb.help/events) on our website to find out when these events will occur.

**Q: How do I keep up with everything going on in FWB?**

Check out [TL;DR](https://www.fwb.help/tldr), FWB‚Äôs weekly roundup of everything that goes down in the Discord. Following us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fwbcollection/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) are a great way to stay in the loop outside of Discord as well. 
 
**Q: I want to meet FWB members from my city! How do I do that?**

Check out the [FWB Events page](https://www.fwb.help/events?_kx=AMdn_qRlahQTnG3OpDHerCfMhA9ZNxqsxlsRpEvRnYk%3D.SLTiGV) to see if there are any IRL events in your area or host a meet up in your city by reaching out to members through location based channels on Discord.

**Q: Where do I find the FWB founding manifesto?** 

You can find the manifesto in the wiki [here](https://wiki.fwb.help/manifesto). 

**Q: How do I become a contributor?**

All members have the opportunity to get involved in the DAO by weighing in on existing projects, voting on proposals, and spinning up proposals for the DAO to vote on. If you are interested in contributing further, there are full-time opportunities available [here](https://www.fwb.help/opportunities).  

## Membership 

**Q: Are there other ways to join FWB once accepted?**

FWB offers scholarships based on merit, need, and inclusiveness of under-represented communities through different programs, including the [Fellowships program](https://www.fwb.help/fellowships). Fellowships applications are currently closed, but will be updated [here](https://www.fwb.help/fellowships) when a new program is announced.

**Q: Are there any recurring membership fees?**

The cost of membership to FWB is not a fee. The FWB token is a means of access to a community. You can hold and liquidate FWB tokens at any time. You will continue to be a member as long as you hold the required number of FWB tokens in your wallet.

**Q: How do I invite friends to join FWB?**

We welcome new members by [application](https://www.fwb.help/join). When inviting friends to join FWB, ask that they list you as a referral in the membership application form. If you would like to vouch for them further, share your take on why they would make a great member in the #referrals channel. 

**Q: Will I lose access to the FWB Discord server if I move my tokens to another wallet?**

Yes, you must connect the wallet that holds your FWB tokens to the Collab.Land bot in our Discord. If you no longer see the #wallet-connect channel in the Discord please open a #help ticket so someone on the Membership team can assist you.

**Q: If my wallet gets hacked, will I still have access to the FWB Discord server?** 

Unfortunately, you will not have access to the FWB Discord server unless you have the specified amount of FWB tokens in your wallet. 

## FWB Token

**Q: How do I purchase FWB tokens?**

If you are holding ETH in your wallet, you can swap your ETH for FWB tokens [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpKXcbkw3Bk&t=5s). For a detailed step-by-step guide, please refer to this video. 

**Q: How do I know if I am purchasing the official FWB token?**

The official FWB token is listed as ‚ÄúFWB Pro‚Äù. The token address can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro). 

**Q: How many tokens do I need to become a member?**

To gain access to the FWB Discord, you will need to hold 75 FWB tokens in your Ethereum wallet.

**Q: Can I purchase FWB tokens before becoming a member?**

We recommend purchasing FWB tokens after you‚Äôve been accepted as a member.

**Q: What else can I do with $FWB tokens?**

Within the community when exchanging services or items with other members, people often offer to exchange in FWB versus fiat. The value of the token can be used to transact in a number of ways functioning as a currency. Holding FWB can also get you access to certain events and communities looking to have FWB members involved in their initiatives.

## Single Tier Membership Transition 

The community [held a vote](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xd78fdde0334355a21c65656538f39de326b97f8023dcd1927b10b58ddeab1e34) in October 2022 to merge the local and global membership into a single tier. This section will address common questions around the transition. If something is not addressed here you can ask a question in the [#locals-only](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/1038065607087759400) channel on Discord, that was opened to discuss the transition. 

**Q: What will people who hold 5 $FWB still be able to access? And what will they lose access to?**

Effective January 15, 2023, existing Local members who continue to hold 5 $FWB would no longer have access to the Discord, digital events, or to the full offerings of the in-development FWB app‚Äîbut would still be able to use their $FWB to attend local events, and will still have access to a limited selection of FWB content and products. Local members who were already a part of FWB at the time of this proposal passing will be given access to full membership benefits for a 90 day period. This includes access to all Discord channels and events, as well as entry into the FWB app once it‚Äôs launched. (Local members who join after this proposal passes will not receive access to this 90 day period.)

**Q: How many Local members will this impact?**

While there are currently ~1,200 Local members, many of them do not participate on a regular basis. While it's difficult to gauge how many of these members are active at IRL events, Discord data shows that of the 1,300 messages posted on average every day, only ~30 are posted by Local members‚Äîmeaning that just 2% of posts come from Local members.

**Q: What channels can't locals see?**

Local members can see approximately 50% of FWB‚Äôs channels. Full members have access to a variety of channels including classifieds, creative channels for filmmakers and musicians, learning channels about DAOs, crypto, and social tokens, lifestyle channels including health-and-wellness, music, plants-and-animals, and selfies-and-fits, an NFT category including the most active channel in the entire discord, trading crypto channels, and more.

**Q: Why keep the main tier at 75 $FWB? Can we take this opportunity to reimagine what FWB membership looks like? How can we make FWB membership more accessible?**

This proposal to move to a singular tier will make it easier for us to further reimagine what FWB membership can be, holistically. Think of this as a first step.

There will also be room to have larger discussions around accessibility initiatives. Community member Alarke Alarke has also proposed a scholarship fund, and discussion has been started around utilizing our Fellowship program to onboard more members.

**Q: How will we generate more interest and value for the 75 $FWB membership?**

Through the roll-out of the fwb.app, we hope to offer FWB‚Äôs first meaningful ‚ÄúPost-Discord‚Äù product that brings deeper connection and conversation to the FWB ecosystem. Additionally, we hope that having a dedicated, FWB-owned distribution channel will improve member communications, governance notifications, and more. Additionally, through the levelsetting of FWB membership into one tier, we will be able to experiment with more egalitarian voting structures, such as one member one vote, that should boost economic activity and innovation within the FWB ecosystem.
