## Member Journey 

Membership in FWB is thought of as an evolution, and our [member journey document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hVBFSPLNrgTHesklCs0HtGQfMUD9tmlu_PnhMXrPaZ0/edit) is designed to reflect that. These steps are sequenced to gradually expose new members to the FWB ecosystem, and to graduate them to the point that they feel enabled to engage in FWB through governance and other forms of contribution. 

The contributing team reviews this journey regularly, keep an eye out for adjustments and changes to optimize experience for members. This journey will evolve continually as the DAO groups and refines new forms of connectivity, like our app. 

## Application Process + Host Committee 

New members looking to join the FWB community will be encouraged to submit a brief application including a brief bio, their interests, and what they could bring to the community. The current application can be found at: [www.fwb.help/join](https://www.fwb.help/join). Applications are reviewed regularly by the host committee and accepted on a rolling basis. 

Once approved, new members will receive an admission email with onboarding instructions. Once their wallet is threshold verified, applicants will be granted into FWB channels. 

FWB’s Host Committee is a rotating group of 20-30 FWB members who vote together to determine who joins the FWB community. The Committee was initially appointed when a membership application process was instated in Season 2, and new committee members are selected based on participation in membership (Co-Pilots, Category Leads), Events (Event Keys, Cities) and Discord participation. Host Committee members understand the value of curating a space and making people feel welcome. While there are not any explicit ‘FWB qualifications’ to join the community, they follow their instincts if an applicant demonstrates that they will contribute to the quality of the community – understanding that part of the decision making will be arbitrary. 

Membership voting criteria: 

- Does this person have a unique vantage point, background, or area of expertise to add to the community?
- Do you get a sense of who this person is outside of their work/professional life? Would I want to sit down and have dinner with this person?
- Is this person already in the Web3 ecosystem? If yes, does their participation fit with our ethos of being at the forefront of web3 x culture?
- Is this person from an under-represented community, an artist or creative maintainer?
- Does the person have a referral from an active FWB member?
- Does this person have the potential of pushing FWB to be broader, weirder, more thoughtful...?

## Co-Pilots

FWB Membership Co-Pilots respond to posts in the #ask-a-question and #introductions channels, and sometimes also join our Host Committee, which reviews all of the incoming membership applications.

## Co-Pilots and Category Leads

As our community grew, we realized our approach to Discord had to change too. In early 2022 under our [‘Discord Maintenance’](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GbU-Px6nz569JA-kY2pU2NwAHScp9Mj9T72h9OxfGU0/edit#heading=h.sesiqic6ufk4) proposal the role of a channel lead was born. This created member-led roles to drive more nuanced discussion in our key channel verticals: Creative, Trading, Lifestyle, and NFTs. 

FWB Membership Co-Pilots respond to posts in the [❓ask-a-question](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/881967496494718996)  and [👋introductions](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/765633590926245959) channels, and sometimes also join our Host Committee, which reviews all of the incoming membership applications. Co-Pilots receive up to 5 $FWB each month for their efforts. Contact KD (@kd) if you’re interested in learning more about our membership programs.
