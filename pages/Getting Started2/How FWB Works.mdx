# How FWB Works

FWB functions as many things: a never ending groupchat, a product studio, festival organizer and more. It is an evolving experiment that can take on many forms. At our core, we are a growing social DAO with more than 3,000 members—including artists, builders, and thinkers from across the crypto and cultural sectors. 
Working across so many utilities, we understand that finding your place within the DAO as a new member can take a bit of time and guidance. Here are our suggestions on how to orient yourself within your first few weeks as a new member of FWB…

## INTRODUCTIONS

Please introduce yourself in #introductions. Friends With Benefits thrives on trust, and we encourage everyone to share their background, specialties and interests to better foster conversations around member's expertise. Many of us change our handles to [FIRST NAME] - @[twitter] to aid this transparency, but it's optional to do so. 

## FIND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD 

Once you are plugged into the Discord, you will notice we have a wide array of channels to dive into (read more about our Discord architecture in the Wiki). One of the best ways we suggest to get involved is to explore the channels like you’d explore the neighborhoods in a new city. Browse around for a bit through the channels to find the conversation starters, photos, and topics that speak to you—these channels will become your home within the larger FWB ecosystem. Engage in discussions to meet like-minded folks who are engaged with the same subjects you are. Our Discord ecosystem is diverse, and we suggest taking it slow by approaching it this way rather than feeling the need to stay up to date with every channel.

## CONTRIBUTE 

There are many ways to contribute to FWB. In addition to participating in the Discord and IRL events, members have the opportunity to get involved with the DAO’s governance, weigh in on existing projects, spin up creative proposals for the DAO to vote on, and receive funding for community-approved projects.

Additionally, members and contributors who help steward the DAO’s ongoing initiatives and operations are compensated for their work. Funded opportunities arise in harmony with the group’s needs, and vary based on the DAO’s evolving priorities.

Here are some of the currently available opportunities for FWB members:

### *Join the core team of full-time and part-time contributors.*

FWB’s core team works across product, marketing, partnerships, membership, and strategy to move the DAO forward. When the core team identifies the need for additional roles, job descriptions are posted on the Opportunities page. DAO members who apply for these roles are prioritized for interviews.

We offer competitive salaries for web3, and contributors can opt to be paid in $FWB tokens, USDC, or a combination of both.

### *Write for TL;DR, our weekly newsletter.*

TL;DR is the DAO's community-driven weekly roundup of what went down in the Discord. Anyone is welcome to contribute 1-4 blurbs of approximately 150 words each per month, recapping significant events and/or conversations from one of our many channels (we're also open to folks writing on other topics). 

Writers receive $FWB tokens as compensation, splitting a pool of $FWB based on how much they contribute in any given month. No writing experience is necessary. Contact Drew (@tonyhawkprogolfer#0691) and Cameron (@cameronparkins) if you’d like to start writing for TL;DR.

### *Help onboard new members.*
FWB Membership Co-Pilots respond to posts in the #ask-a-question and #introductions channels, and some join our Host Committee. The Host Committee reviews incoming membership applications. Co-Pilots receive up to 5 $FWB each month for their efforts. Contact KD (@kd#3038) if you’re interested in learning more about our membership programs.

### *Bring your creative ideas to life.*
FWB regularly offers open calls for special opportunities like creative residencies, fellowships, and grants. This season, the programs include:
FWB Garage™️ distributes $50k per season across a number of creative projects proposed by DAO members. Learn more in the [#garage-grants](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/983855420701560872) channel.
Event Keys create city-specific experiences for the FWB community to come together locally, with an eye toward programming, building relationships, and strengthening local networks. Learn more in the [#city-keys](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/981242375647137832) channel.

### *Hang out and chat in FWB’s Discord.*
We use a tool called FairShare to reward FWB members for their active participation in the Discord. The more you chat, react, and get mentioned by other members, the more $FWB you can earn.
