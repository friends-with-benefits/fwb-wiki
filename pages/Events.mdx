## Event Keys

Event Keys was born out of a need to further decentralize our IRL event programming and expand our reach beyond the diversity of events coming from our Cities subDAOs (formerly LA, New York, and London).

Event Keys create city-specific experiences for the FWB community to come together locally, with an eye toward programming, building relationships, and strengthening local networks. Part of the idea behind Event Keys is that they are accessible: they are not necessarily full-fledged exhibitions or parties that require exorbitant funding or a high demand run-of-show. Event keys are often more low-lift gatherings whose resources are the onus of the group to source. Think: direct-payable direct dinners, art crawls, picnics, film screenings, or food tours.

### FWB Dinner Parties

This Spring, FWB Event Keys will manifest as dinner parties. you're cordially invited to host a shared meal for and with other FWB members. Use this as a chance to connect with more FWB members in your region, share a delicious meal, and cook up some new friendships.

<b> How it works: </b>

• Use [this form](https://airtable.com/shr05mgzfQqovtove) to share your interest in hosting a dinner party in your space.

• If approved, you will receive $250 USDC to spend on dinner-related expenses.

• Aim for 10+ guests, with at least 50% being FWB members.

• All official dinner parties will be added to our [Events page](https://www.fwb.help/events) via Gatekeeper so other FWB members can find them + RSVP.

• FWB's Events team will provide lightweight support to hosts to ensure your dinner party is set up for success.

• Note that all hosts will be asked to share a recipe + photos from your dinner, which we'll be compiling into a cookbook and digital zine for FWB members.

#### FAQs:

<b> What’s expected of dinner party hosts? </b>

Hosts are expected to arrange and/or cook a meal for dinner attendees, and welcome all FWB members who RSVP into their space (note that it’s possible to limit the number of people who can RSVP). This could mean you make your dinner party a potluck and ask guests to bring a dish to share, or it could mean you make a huge batch of your grandma’s famous spaghetti and provide wine and mocktails. If you can offer versions of your dish that suit various dietary restrictions, that’s great (but not required). Hosts are also expected to help promote their dinner party and do some outreach to ensure their dinner will be well attended. Lastly, hosts are expected to follow the FWB code of conduct and ensure their party is as accessible and friendly as possible.

<b> Do I need to live in one of FWB’s main cities to host a dinner party? </b>

If you live in NYC, LA, SF, or London, that’s great—there are lots of FWB members near you, and it shouldn’t be too tricky to build a robust guest list. If you live in a region where fewer FWB members live, you’ll need to do some research/outreach to make sure enough FWB members live nearby who can come to your event. Aim to have 10 or more people at your dinner, with at least 50% of attendees being FWB members. To find members in your area, try asking in your nearest region on Discord (under the FWB REGION channel category) to see who might be your neighbor.

<b> How will FWB support dinner party hosts? </b>

FWB will supply each host with 250 USDC to spend on your dinner in whatever way makes sense. We’ll also help spread the word about the dinner party series through social media and our Events page, and we’ll provide some general tips and best practices to help ensure your dinner party is a success.

### The Short Version

**Digital Event Expectations:**

If you are hosting a Digital Event, expectations are as follows:

- Well thought out event that sounds professional and starts promptly. If the event is recurring, it should be reliable.
- Share description/guests/topics minimum 48hrs before air time, and ideally by Wednesday at midnight the week prior so we can get it in tl;dr.
- Strive for a minimum attendance of 2% of the active FWB community, and track event attendance. (This amounts to around 20 people in the audience)
- Record and share recordings after the event if you want the event to be archived.
- Engage with the editorial team and community for event promotion.

People showing up for live events is the best metric for success. You will report your real-time attendance, and we will have the data on how many people listen to the archived version of the show. We also of course encourage soliciting feedback on your event so you can improve for the next time :)

**What To Do Before And After Each Event:**

Before: You must submit [this form](https://forms.gle/bhciK4dGrtufEMeN7) at least 48 hours before your event, preferably by Thursday the week before your show so we can promote in tl;dr. This form includes date, time, location (which voice channel will you be on? Is it on main stage? Is it on zoom? Twitter spaces?), show description and a spot to upload art if you have any.

After: Submit [this form](https://forms.gle/7LHAUtaouKC1jxqW6) after each event. This is where you report attendance and give us a link to your event recording if you want it to be archived. This form must be submitted within 24 hours of the event.

**How to record**

If you know how to record from discord using Krisp, OBS, Garageband or Soundflower, please feel free to do so. Here is a guide to using [Krisp](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZm6uZoaCWPpy2bXhCTeV96OUWIrn18J9J_3z1mG6LA/edit?usp=sharing) and here is a guide for [OBS.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJssyu6DNQsjQtdgKS-OwqKunkaMiEraagGMk3fmNJ4/edit) You can always reach out to Zoe in the [#digitalevents](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/984259876433829948) channel for help with recording but there is no guarantee that she will be free to record.

If you host your event on Zoom or Twitter Spaces, recording is easy peasy!

### A Step-By-Step Guide

**STEP 1: Lock in the details and get on the calendar**

First, we need to get you on the schedule. We need a title, description of your event, location and a date/time at least 48 hours in advance. You can try to find a good time by taking a look at the [FWB Events Calendar](https://www.fwb.help/events) and finding an empty block of time. It is best to leave some buffer between each event to allow more folks to attend and avoid channel overlap. For locations, either tell us which discord voice channel you will be in, or include a zoom link or a twitter spaces link etc. Once you have all of the info, please fill out the [FWB Digital Events - Calendar Info Form](https://forms.gle/MaQ7RoEHvKN1Tj238) so that we can add the event to the events page, discord calendar and to the google calendar. You can also upload art or a flier here which adds some color to your post when it gets announced on the discord. (If you send along art, make sure it is less than 10 MB).

**STEP 2: Plan your event**

Events are best received when they are well thought out. Who are your guests? Do you want people to be able to participate in the conversation?

Do you want this event to be archived? If so, how are you going to record your event? Do you have guests who are not on the discord? If so, we will need to grant them access so we will need to know ahead of time.

**STEP 3: Show Time**

Make sure you have everything ready to go. Here are some things to think about:

- Getting outside guests into the discord. You will need to send their discord handles to Derek or Raihan ahead of time. Give them at least 24 hours of warning and be sure to follow up with them an hour before your event so we aren’t scrambling at the last minute.
- Recording your event. If you want your event to be archived, you are responsible for getting it recorded. If you know how to record from discord already, awesome! If not, you can use [Krisp Audio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZm6uZoaCWPpy2bXhCTeV96OUWIrn18J9J_3z1mG6LA/edit?usp=sharing) or OBS to do so. We highly recommend trying this out early!! It isn't trivial and you don't want to be troubleshooting this real time. HINT: Recording on zoom is SUPER easy, and you get video! So this is not a bad option. Twitter Spaces also records for you so that is another easy solution. When you are done recording your event, save it as either an mp3 (audio) or mp4 (video). The file must be named like this: YYYYMMDD_Event Name.mp3 You will include a link to this file when you submit to the archive (Step 4).
- Reporting real time attendance. You must give us a rough count of how many people attended your event in real time. It doesn’t need to be exact, but try to give us a ballpark number.
- Sound Quality. This one is HUGE!! While discord chaos is charming, it can also get annoying. We recommend that you and your guests do your calls with headphones on to optimize your mic sounds and limit risk of echos and discord sounds. It is also great if you can turn off your discord notification sounds and silence any other notifications on your computer and your phone. Also, pay attention to your audience and mute them or ask them to mute if they are making a lot of noise. If you need someone to help server mute, you can reach out to anyone in the AV Club to help, but usually a polite call out will do the trick.

**STEP 4: Submit to the archive and provide a post-event report.**

When you are done with your event, fill out this form: FWB Digital Events - Post-Event Report and Archive Submission. This form has to be submitted within 24 hours of the event.

This is where you can tell us your attendance and give us your recording to upload to the archive. You can give us a more detailed description of the event to be attached to the entry in the archive, think podcast show notes. You can also upload art here if you hadn’t added it in time to make it on the calendar.
