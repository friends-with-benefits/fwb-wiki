## Discord

Access to the network of members in FWB’s private discord is one of the most substantial benefits of being a part of the DAP. Our community is an interdependent internet ecosystem that spans many time zones. For a lot of folks, seeing the channel directory can feel overwhelming. 

Scrolling down a thread in discord or falling down a rabbit hole on a new curiosity feels like taking a walk in a new neighborhood on the internet.   Like most cities, FWB has different pockets of cultures & scenes — from fashion, to design, to music, to degen, to mental health, to NFTs, degen, skincare, local food, filmmakers, and so much more. Every channel is its own neighborhood. Let’s talk about how to get around town: 
- At the top right of each channel screen, there is a button to look at “Threads” and “Pinned Messages”.
- Threads are used to dive-in on a topic without cluttering the main channel. They are archived after inactivity.
- Pinned messages are highlighted by staff and can be a great way to get up to speed on a channel.

FWB channels have been described as “saloon-style” chat rooms and each have their own regular members. Take a look through the channel names and see what speaks to you, and check back on a regular basis to get involved and learn more.
