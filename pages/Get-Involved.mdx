# Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to FWB. In addition to participating in the Discord and IRL events, members have the opportunity to get involved with the DAO’s governance, weigh in on existing projects, spin up creative proposals for the DAO to vote on, and receive funding for community-approved projects.

Additionally, members and contributors who help steward the DAO’s ongoing initiatives and operations are compensated for their work. Funded opportunities arise in harmony with the group’s needs, and vary based on the DAO’s evolving priorities.

Browse through this section to find some of the currently available opportunities for FWB members…

## Partnerships

FWB has paired with a number of established and emerging brands in a range of partnerships -- from our community-voted mate blend with [Taika](https://mate.taika.co/) to a programming series with [Hennessy](https://www.cafe11.xyz/). Our team is open to exploring a range of partnerships that work off of the DAOs strengths in cultural programming, editorial, within the app and at FWB fest. If you have an opportunity you'd like to chat to us about you can send the team an email at [collaborations@fwb.help](collaborations@fwb.help).

## Events

FWB hosts a regular slate of URL and IRL events. Most of our digital events are hosted via the voice channels in our Discord server, with the occasional event on Zoom or Twitter Spaces. FWB activates IRL across the globe, through more formalized programming like FWB FEST and decentralized programming through our city keys program and casual meet ups.

Any member can propose an event for funding through an program like city keys, or can form a proposal to present to the community if they are seeking more funding. Through our location based channels channels, people often host more casual meet ups with other local members to gather at a coffee shop or try a new restaurant.

Check our [Events page](https://wiki.fwb.help/Events) below for more information.

## Voting

FWB uses a token-weighted voting system with no quorum. We use a decentralized voting system called [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) to vote on all proposals. [View our archive](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth) of Snapshot votes.

Delegation is an option if token holders want to navigate to Snapshot and delegate their votes, however it is not time-boxed and is not part of a formal process.

Community members are able to submit proposals by first filling out a micro-proposal to the Governance Team who then prepares that proposal for #live-discussion. Proposals are in #live-discussion for a minimum of 5 days. Proposals are then moved from #live-discussion to Snapshot and then ultimately voted on (see the proposal section after this for more details).

**_Voting Topics_**

The Governance Team reviews proposals to ensure they are in alignment with FWB’s mission and values and the overall health of the DAO. Similarly, there is not a formal split as to which things go to Snapshot and which can be decided within Discord or another forum. Generally, our best practices are applied such that those items that have a meaningful impact to the DAOs resources (treasury, human capital, etc.) are taken to Snapshot vote.

**_Voting Timelines_**

While we do not have a set time for how long proposals must stay up on Snapshot, we typically require a minimum of 3 working days for any proposal, and often 7 full days.

## Putting up a Proposal

1. Community led proposals start as an idea and are workshopped in whatever the way the proposer(s) want: alone, in the Discord, or with the proposal review committee.

2. When the proposal is sufficiently coherent the proposer(s) will fill out the [FWB Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYMfg9n2FOWm8qyRSxaVLcw2f0lhUwjLd1jDLKYVGwQ/edit).

3. Contributors must make any conflict of interest (potential or possible) disclosures as necessary within the proposal.

4. The proposal is shared with the Proposal Review Committee who will provide feedback and connect the proposer(s) with relevant FWB teams that may have feedback. The finance team is always included to review that the proposal’s budgetary impact has been accurately estimated.

5. After this feedback is provided and the proposer(s) feel confident then the proposal is posted to #live-proposals where everyone is notified and public final feedback is provided. There is no set time it is up for, but we tend to have a best practice of at least 1 week.

6. The proposer(s) adjusts their proposal as they want and the Proposal Review Committee will then post it to Snapshot for community vote and notify everyone.

## Channel Leads

As our community continues to grow, we realize our approach to Discord has to evolve with us. In early 2022 under our [‘Discord Maintenance’](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GbU-Px6nz569JA-kY2pU2NwAHScp9Mj9T72h9OxfGU0/edit#heading=h.sesiqic6ufk4) proposal the role of a channel lead was created. We introduced member-led roles to drive more nuanced discussion in our key channel verticals: Creative, Trading, Lifestyle, Learning and NFTs.

Category leads are tasked with connecting people, stirring conversation, and coming up with benefits on a channel-specific basis. Initially, Category Leads were selected by the Membership team based on past channel activity, as well as by peer- and self-nomination to ensure it's a diverse and inclusive group. Overall, Category Leads will continue to work to make everyone feel welcome and included in the Discord by ensuring their designated channel offers clear, meaningful ways to participate. The proposal gives each category lead two seasons in their role, with the chance to renew within the nomination process the proposal indicates.
