# Calendar & Public Works

All FWB initiatives are chronicled in the section of our Discord called [FWB Public Works.](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/1064966279317954761) Here you’ll be able to see what’s being actively worked on, get a sense of what the DAO is prioritizing, and offer feedback. Each active project has a channel within the Public Works forum to direct your questions and feedback. The core team posts bi-weekly updates from each department in the [#fwb-updates channel](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/1064966106491650068) as well. 

All team initatives are mapped out in our [working calendar](https://airtable.com/shryIOLKK7T5JmB1E/tblXSK2H7RSHINZ8v). This is updated on a weekly basis buy core team members and recurring contributors.
