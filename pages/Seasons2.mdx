# Seasons

Inspired by Simon de la Rouvière’s writing on tokenomics and social communities, FWB moved towards a seasonal model in 2021. Years are divided into ‘seasons.’ Initially tied to a traditional  quarterly system, FWB’s seasons are now indicative of a change in direction or evolution of the DAO and its goals. 

Dividing the year into Seasons provides clear on-ramps and off-ramps for experimentation. The Seasons model allows the community to experiment with various governance mechanisms to reward members' participation. Each season various governance processes and reward mechanics are tested, with some continuing onto the next Season, and others discarded in favor of new processes and mechanics.

The Seasons model allows FWB to rapidly experiment with community mechanics and processes, while mitigating the risk of incurring legacy debt from structural decisions made in the past.

The hope is that Seasons will better engage community members and reward top contributors with additional benefits—the first step towards rewarding active participation and creating a more engaged community.
