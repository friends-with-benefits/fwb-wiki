## Origins of FWB

Trevor McFedries founded FWB in the early weeks of September 2020. The premise was simple: he wanted to start an experiment gathering some of his favorite minds across culture and technology to convene in a digital space and see what they’d do together. The earliest members were friends and friends-of-friends, from world-renowned DJs and producers, to fashionistas, actors and OG crypto folks alike.

In the beginning, the Discord was minimal – #general-chat may have been the only channel, but it was a lively one. The [first message](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/749443579499511860/750981869348061234) that Trevor sent in the chat seems to have set the tone for the overall community as it came together and flourished.

After the intros channel was established in early 2021, some of our most notable community members started out just by dropping their introduction and sharing a few things that interest them (beyond crypto and DeFi). This is part of why we encourage all new members to drop an intro when they join—you never know who might check the archives and find you later.

## Roll Hack & First Town Hall 

FWB’s token was affected in the Roll Hack of March 2021. This [article](https://thedefiant.io/social-tokens-get-rolled-on) and this [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1371039886657085445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) are a good place to start to understand the Roll Hack logistically. Essentially a hacker dumped most of the social tokens that the platform Roll was holding in hot wallets for its respective organizations (FWB was one of 10+ affected by this hack). FWB was one of the DAOs hit the hardest, losing about ~800 ETH. The value of an FWB token went from about 90-100 USD to 0.10 USD overnight as a result of this hack. Because of the rapid decrease in value of the tokens, post the hack many people bought vast sums of FWB hoping for rebound in token price to its former high. 

This hack resulted in our first governance process occurring to decide what to do post the hack, and ultimately a vote happened to decide if we should issue a new token or not. Our first town hall was actually held to discuss this proposal before the vote was held (in a lofi way, see picture below of the vote).

The community decided on $FWB Pro replacing $FWB Classic. [This post](https://medium.com/friends-with-benefits/introducing-fwb-pro-313d62183678) on the FWB pro transition details the logistics of the transition, and other mitigations made to account for the old token holder’s holdings and other factors associated with the transition. 

## FWB Roadmap & Fall 2021 Fundraise

While a traditional company or organization may have the privilege of one explicit reason for existence, the FWB DAO emerged first as a social community – making sense of how the Web3 world was evolving and affecting culture –that then came together to determine what it's focus areas should be. Because of this expansion, FWB began to explore new funding options. This involved a series of events with potential investors and community members. Viewing FWB as a digital city, this proposal was the way of growing its suburbs.

The first Roadmap presented to the FWB community from FWB contributors was shared in a community Town Hall on August 16, 2021. This outlined the planned expansion of FWB internally and the benefits of bringing on these investors to accomplish these goals.

This process culminated in a community vote to decide to move forward with funding or not. The Snapshot proposal [here](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmUFFkMER4R54dnBRJXL3WTLsktfUTK8KrdTwBbZmRTjSn) outlines the structure of the investment that the community decided to move forward with. 

## FWB Fest

On the weekend of August 12, 2021 the FWB community convened IRL for a weekend in Idyllwild, California for the first [‘FWB FEST’](https://fest.fwb.help/). The event spanned talks with cultural creators and technologists, live music, group workshops, pool hangs and an expansive food and beverage program as well.
