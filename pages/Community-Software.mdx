## FWB.app Roadmap

This high-level roadmap covers the work that the FWB Product Team is currently focused on for FWB.app, in addition to general maintenance and bug-bashing.

| Active Projects       | Upcoming Projects               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Permissions and Roles | Channels                        |
| In-App Messaging      | Notifications V2                |
| Editable Avatars      | Video Posts                     |
|                       | Geotagging/Check-Ins            |
|                       | Native Gatekeeper Functionality |
|                       | Native Governance Functionality |

- Permissions and Roles is a major upgrade to our back-end that creates opportunities for richer experiences inside of the app
- In-app messaging will clear the way for users to DM one another natively instead of needing to coordinate on other platforms
- Editable avatars, because sometimes you're just feeling like a bit of an update on how people perceive you, you know
- Channels will create a new experience around the feed... think #tokyocityguide and #official and you're on the right track
- Notifications V2 will allow for more granular, user-editable choices around what activity you get push notifications for
- Video posts, because sometimes you have to show off a sick ollie or a particularly perfect espresso pull
- Geotagging/Check-Ins are a module that will attach to posts... let the homies know where to meet you
- Native Gatekeeper functionality will allow users to create, manage, and RSVP to events directly in the app
- Native Governance functionality will allow users to create, manage, and vote on proposals directly in the app


## FWB.app

The FWB Directory will serve as a traversable on-chain identity that enables our members to connect, grow, and move fluidly across the Web3 ecosystem. Members will be able to search and engage with other members based on shared communities, indexed skills, and past IRL events theyâ€™ve attended. At the heart of the FWB Directory is your ID, a unique non-transferable NFT that is minted upon your membership initiation.

Each profile is composed of

- A unique NFT membership card
- Unique Directory URL
- Members can include their wallet address to their profiles
- A status can be chosen and edited
- Links such as social media, portfolios, GitHub, Mirror, etc can be included
- An interest selection list
- Top Friends ðŸ™‚
- Community statistics: a memberâ€™s latest votes, or lack thereof
- Stickers, for the card

*Why?*

In late August 2021, we conducted a survey of over 200 FWB members and found that the majority of them wanted to do three things:

1. Forms new relationships, both professional or friendly
2. Meet new members based on shared interests, affinities, or skills
3. Finally, find collaborators for new projects

This knowledge fundamentally informed the design of Member Directory. There was a fatal flaw in Discord which hindered the ability of community members to get to know each other, Discord was not made for connecting new friends or forming friendships. It lacked any richness in the details it provides about other members of a server. We built Directory as a layer of identity on Discord which would help our members get to know one another.

## Gatekeeper 

[Gatekeeper](gatekeep.it/) allows you to create token-enabled physical experiences by providing a complete set of solutions to create events and manage attendance against a set of token-based criteria.

You can use a single token or combination of tokens to set up an event page, invite friends, and confirm who's coming. Gatekeeper handles the rest: it validates each RSVP to ensure it matches your criteria, and provides a portable and accessible interface to manage the attendees at the door on the day of your event.

Up to date documentation on Gatekeeper can be found [here](https://docs.gatekeep.it/), with info on what it supports and how to implement it for your needs.
